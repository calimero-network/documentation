Calimero uses **cryptographic identities** to manage access control and authentication across the network. Each participant has one or more identities that prove ownership and grant permissions.

## Identity Model

Calimero supports a hierarchical identity model:

flowchart LR
    ROOT[Root Key<br/>alice.near] --> CLIENT1[Client Key A]
    ROOT --> CLIENT2[Client Key B]
    ROOT --> CLIENT3[Client Key C]
    
    CLIENT1 --> CTX1[Context A]
    CLIENT2 --> CTX2[Context B]
    CLIENT3 --> CTX3[Context C]
    
    style ROOT fill:#000000,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:4px,color:#ffffff
    style CLIENT1 fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
    style CLIENT2 fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
    style CLIENT3 fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
    style CTX1 fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
    style CTX2 fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
    style CTX3 fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
```

### Root Keys

A **root key** is an authentication credential that represents a user's master identity in the Calimero auth system. It's typically:

- Generated from a NEAR wallet or from username / password combination
- Used for high-level operations (creating contexts, managing memberships)
- Stored securely (hardware wallet, keychain, etc.)

### Client Keys

**Client keys** are derived from root keys and used for:

- Executing methods in specific contexts
- Signing transactions and deltas
- Proving membership in contexts

**Benefits:**

- **Isolation**: Compromise of one client key doesn't affect others
- **Revocation**: Can revoke access per-context without changing root key
- **Privacy**: Different keys for different contexts

## Identity Generation

Generate identities with `meroctl`:

```bash
$: meroctl --node node1 context identity generate
> +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
> | Context Identity Generated              | Public Key                                  |
> +=======================================================================================+
> | Successfully generated context identity | 8XG254iKm6YGNJANbkKQpFknmE27TykArAvfJPqHBmw |
> +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

See [`core/crates/meroctl/README.md`](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/blob/master/crates/meroctl/README.md) for CLI details.

## Blockchain Wallet Integration

Calimero supports wallet-based authentication:

| Protocol | Identity Source |
| --- | --- |
| **NEAR** | NEAR account ID + signature |


**Flow:**
1. User connects wallet
2. Signs challenge message
3. Calimero verifies signature
4. JWT token issued

See [`calimero-client-js/README.md`](https://github.com/calimero-network/calimero-client-js#readme) for client authentication examples.

## Authentication Flows

For wallet authentication examples, see:
- **JavaScript**: [`calimero-client-js/README.md`](https://github.com/calimero-network/calimero-client-js#readme) - Client-side auth flows
- **Python**: [`calimero-client-py/README.md`](https://github.com/calimero-network/calimero-client-py#readme) - Python client auth

## JWT Tokens

After authentication, Calimero issues JWT tokens containing:
- `context_id` - Target context
- `executor_public_key` - Client key for execution
- `permissions` - Access permissions
- `exp` - Expiration timestamp

**Usage:**
- Include in API requests: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Tokens expire and can be refreshed
- See [`core/crates/auth/README.md`](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/blob/master/crates/auth/README.md) for details

## Key Management

**Hierarchical structure:**
- Root keys delegate to client keys per context
- Each context has separate client keys
- Keys can be revoked independently

**Revoke access:**
```bash
$: meroctl --node <NODE_ID> context identity revoke <MEMBER_ALIAS> <CAPABILITY> --as <REVOKER_ALIAS> --context <CONTEXT_ALIAS>
```

See [`core/crates/meroctl/README.md`](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/blob/master/crates/meroctl/README.md) for key management commands.

**What happens:**
- Key is removed from context membership
- Key can no longer sign transactions for that context
- Existing transactions remain valid (immutable history)
- Root key remains unaffected
- Removed member stops receiving updates

## Wallet Adapters

Calimero provides wallet adapters for easy integration:

### JavaScript Client

```typescript
import {
  CalimeroConnectButton,
} from "@calimero-network/calimero-client";

// Automatically handles node connection and authentication
<CalimeroConnectButton />
```

**Supported wallets:**
- NEAR Wallet

### Python Client

```python
from calimero_client_py import create_connection, create_client

# Connect to Calimero network
connection = create_connection(
    api_url="https://node.calimero.network",
    node_name="your-node-name"  # Optional but recommended for token caching
)

# Create a client from the connection
client = create_client(connection)
...
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Client Keys**: Don't use root keys directly for context operations
2. **Rotate Keys**: Periodically rotate client keys for security
3. **Secure Storage**: Store private keys in secure keychains, never in code
4. **Multi-Sig Support**: Use multi-signature wallets for high-value contexts
5. **Key Backup**: Backup root keys securely (hardware wallet, paper backup)
